## Favortie CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 3 part 2
This lab was fun because it was one of our first real labs where we had to figure things out on our own while applying the concepts we’ve been learning in lecture. It wasn’t too difficult of a task but it was a very fun one to work through for sure because it prepared me for the semester. It taught me the basics of int variables and how they work in functions.

Lab 10 Part 1

This lab was a good breather from all the labs we did beforehand because it was only 1 part but it was a very simple task as well. From my own personal experience with my partner I didn’t have too much struggle with it and I felt that it was easy to apply my lecture knowledge alot faster than I have been from the previous labs. This lab taught me how to combine if statements and for loops to create a function that sifts through a list file.

Lab 11 Part 1

This lab despite being two parts made it a lot easier for more to finish still as well, this part in particular was very repetitive so it made it easier to code and understand. It was using mainly for loops and if statements once again with parameters this time to sift through a table to look for a specific setting due to user input.
